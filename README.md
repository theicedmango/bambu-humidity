Humidity Widget to Imitate the Style of a Bambu Labs Slicer

This humidity widget is designed to help users track one of the most overlooked things when it comes to 3D printing - humidity! When I got into 3D printing, it was incredibly frustrating to find out that so many print problems come from humidity, yet there are no integrated ways to keep track of it.

I've created this humidty widget, which can seamlessly integrate into the UI of Bambu Studio. For the time being, it uses Open-Meteo API to track outdoor humidity of a user-selected city. The variations in humidty dynamically update the data on the widget, letting the users know if there are further actions that they need to take to ensure print success.
